# n8n-nodes-discord-bridge

![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

This project is a fork of [n8n-nodes-discord](https://github.com/edbrdi/n8n-nodes-discord) with improvements and additional features. All modifications and translations have been assisted by AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

[n8n](https://www.n8n.io) nodes to trigger workflows from Discord or send interactive messages. Uses the components API which allows creating dialogs (for example, attaching buttons and waiting for the user to click on them).

These nodes do not use webhooks but a Discord bot to enable bidirectional communication. The bot automatically starts in a main process once configured and forwards or receives data from child processes when a node is executed.

## Installation

Follow the installation instructions in the [n8n community nodes documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

### Local Development

To start developing this node, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start watching for changes
npm run dev

# Build the node
npm run build
```

## Usage

This node provides a bridge between n8n and Discord, allowing you to:

- Trigger n8n workflows from Discord events
- Send interactive messages to Discord channels
- Create dialogs with buttons and wait for user interactions
- Track reactions on messages

## How to Install

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-discord-bridge` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Accept the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in the **Nodes** panel search results.

### Manual Installation

To get started, install the package in your n8n root directory:

`npm install n8n-nodes-discord-bridge`

For Docker-based deployments, add the following line before the font installation command in your [n8n Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile):

`RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install n8n-nodes-discord-bridge`

## Bot Configuration

To send, listen to messages, get the list of channels or roles, you need to configure a bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

First, create an application by clicking **New Application** in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Go to **OAuth2** and copy the client ID. On your n8n instance, you will create new Discord App credentials (**Credentials > New > Search "Discord App" > Continue**) and paste the Client ID in the corresponding field. Don't close the window yet.

Return to your created application's Discord Developer Portal, go to **Bot** and click **Add Bot**. In the **Authorization Flow**, disable **Public Bot**. Enable all **Privileged Gateway Intents** then save your changes.

![](images/bot-1.png)

Go to **OAuth > URL Generator**, select the **bot** and **applications.commands** scopes, the bot permission **administrator** then copy the generated URL at the bottom.

![](images/url-gen.png)

Now use this link to add the bot to your Discord server. You must be logged into Discord in the browser with the same account where you have **Manage Server** or **Administrator** permissions on the server where you want to add the bot.

Once your bot is added to your server, you need to get the bot token and add it to your Discord App credentials. Simply click **Copy** on your bot page or **Reset Token** if the **Copy** button is not visible.

![](images/credentials-2.png)

Save your credentials and go to **Settings > n8n API**, click **Create API Key** or select the existing one, copy the key, reopen your Discord App credentials (**Credentials > Open**), paste the key in the **n8n API Key** field and set your base URL (e.g. https://n8n.example.com/api/v1). Don't forget to save again.

You can now use the **Discord Trigger** and **Discord Send** nodes in your workflows. The first time you configure one of these nodes, it will start the bot.

## Discord Trigger Node Reference

- **Discord App Credentials**: If you followed the bot configuration guide above, you will be able to select your Discord App credentials to start the bot. If you are already using another Discord Trigger (or Send) node, be careful to select the same credentials. It is not currently intended to be used with multiple Discord servers.
- **Listen to**: Lets you select the text channels you want to monitor to trigger the workflow. If none are selected, all channels will be monitored. Your credentials must be configured and the bot running, you also need at least one text channel available. If you don't meet these requirements, make the changes then close and reopen the window (the channels list is loaded when the window opens). For "User" trigger types, if you want to use a placeholder, select the channel where you want it to appear.
- **From roles**: The same logic applies here for roles, except it's optional. If you don't select any role, it will listen to **@everyone**.
- **Trigger type**: Type of event to listen to. User events must specify a channel to listen to if you want to use a placeholder or the "send to trigger channel" option in a Discord Send node.
  - **Message**: Listen to messages sent in selected channels.
  - **Command**: Listen to commands sent in selected channels.
  - **Interaction**: Listen to persistent buttons/select.
  - **Reaction**: Listen to reactions added or removed on messages.

  - **Equal**: Matches the exact value.
  - **Starts with**: Matches the beginning of the message with the specified value.
  - **Contains**: Matches the value at any position in the message.
  - **Ends with**: Matches the end of the message with the specified value.

## Commands

To help you create and debug your workflow with the Discord Trigger/Send nodes, some commands have been registered for the bot.

- `/logs`: Displays the last logs stored in memory (max 100).
  - **With parameters**
    - `/logs 10`: If you specify a number, it will display the number of last logs.
    - `/logs clear`: Deletes all logs in memory.
    - `/logs on`: Logs are automatically sent in the current channel.
    - `/logs off`: Disables logs automatically sent in the channel.
- `/clear`: Deletes the last messages (max 100) in the current channel.
  - **With parameters**
    - `/clear 10`: If you specify a number, it will delete the number of last messages.
- `/test`: Toggles test mode. Test mode toggles the Discord bot to the trigger's test URL. Useful if you want to see how a workflow is executed and how data is transmitted. Once test mode is enabled, go to the Discord Trigger interface and click **Get test event** then on Discord send a message to trigger the workflow.
  - **With parameters**
    - `/test true`: Enables test mode.
    - `/test false`: Disables test mode.

## Troubleshooting

- There is a [known issue](https://github.com/edbrdi/n8n-nodes-discord/issues/10) with the update process or some new installations resulting in the missing Discord icon (nodes not recognized). To fix this, you just need to restart n8n.
- If you can't update the nodes via the interface, try uninstalling and reinstalling them.
- Before reporting an issue, make sure you have properly configured the bot (especially permissions) and that your triggers are enabled. You cannot test a disabled trigger.
